According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC), heart disease is the
major cause of death in the United States. Around 647,000 Americans die from heart
disease each year. In 2017, 365,914 people died because of coronary heart disease ( CHD)
only. CHD is considered as the most common type of heart disease.
therefore, the project goal is to identify the factor risks of coronary heart disease so it can
help reduce those rates using a logistic regression algorithm. The dataset used in this
project is from the Framingham Heart study dataset. It is an ongoing heart study on
